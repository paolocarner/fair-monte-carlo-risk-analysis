A professional, web-based tool for conducting quantitative cybersecurity risk assessments using the FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) methodology.

![Dashboard Preview](docs/images/dashboard-preview.png)

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 **Interactive Monte Carlo Simulation** - Run 1,000 to 50,000 simulations for statistical rigor
- 🌍 **External vs Internal Factor Grouping** - Clear visual distinction between controllable and uncontrollable risk factors
- 🎚️ **Configurable Risk Tolerance** - Set custom thresholds (Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive/Custom) aligned with your risk appetite
- 💡 **Comprehensive Help System** - 35+ in-context tooltips with FAIR-aligned definitions
- 📊 **Rich Visualizations** - Interactive charts with distribution, exceedance curves, percentiles, and LEF analysis
- 🎨 **Preset Scenarios** - 9 pre-configured risk scenarios for common threats (Ransomware, Data Breach, BEC, DDoS, Insider Threat, Zero-Day, Device Theft, System Outage, Supply Chain)
- 💰 **ROI Calculators** - Built-in ROSI analysis and insurance recommendation tools
- 📥 **Multiple Export Formats** - JSON, CSV, and formatted text reports
- 🎓 **Educational Design** - UI teaches FAIR principles through its structure

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fair-risk-dashboard.git
cd fair-risk-dashboard

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the dashboard
streamlit run fair_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### First Use

1. Load a preset scenario (e.g., "Ransomware Attack")
2. Click the (?) help icons to learn FAIR terminology
3. Adjust parameters to match your organization
4. Click "Run Simulation"
5. Explore the four visualization tabs
6. Export your results

## 📊 Understanding the Interface

### External vs Internal Factors

The dashboard clearly distinguishes between factors you can and cannot control:

**🌍 External Factors (Threat Landscape)**
- **Contact Frequency** - Industry-wide threat volume, a count of contacts per year (you can't control)

**🏢 Internal Factors (Your Organization)**
- **Threat Event Frequency** *(derived as Contact Frequency × Probability of Action)* **& Probability of Action** - Your attractiveness as a target (partially controllable)
- **Vulnerability** - Your security control effectiveness (directly controllable)
- **Loss Magnitudes** - Your specific costs and exposure (partially controllable)

This distinction is fundamental to making smart security investment decisions.

## 🎓 FAIR Methodology

This tool implements the FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) standard for quantitative risk analysis:

```
Risk = Loss Event Frequency × Loss Magnitude

Where:
  LEF = Threat Event Frequency × Vulnerability
  TEF = Contact Frequency × Probability of Action
  LM = Primary Loss + Secondary Loss (when applicable)
```
